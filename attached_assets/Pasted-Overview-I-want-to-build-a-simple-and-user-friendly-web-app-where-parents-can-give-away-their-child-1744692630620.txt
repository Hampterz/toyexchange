Overview:
I want to build a simple and user-friendly web app where parents can give away their children's unused or gently-used toys to other families for free. The goal is to reduce waste, encourage sharing, and help families who may not be able to afford new toys. Think of it as a Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, but specifically for free toy exchanges and built with a clean, modern, and safe interface for parents.

Key Features:

User Registration and Profiles

Parents can sign up using email, Google, or Facebook

Each profile includes a name, general location (city or ZIP only, no full address), and their posted toys

Post a Toy

Upload toy details: title, description, age range, condition (new, like new, used), and category (plush, action figure, educational, etc.)

Upload up to 4 images

Select pickup location (approximate area or meet-up spot, no home addresses shown)

Browse Toys

Filter by location, age range, category, or condition

Search by keyword

Option to “favorite” a listing for later

Request a Toy

Button to “Request Toy”

Sender must write a short message to the toy owner

Owner gets notified and can approve or reject the request

Messaging

Basic in-app messaging system for arranging pickups

No personal contact info needed until both parties are ready

Safety and Moderation

Report button on each listing or profile

Admin dashboard to manage flagged posts or users

Responsive Design

Fully mobile-friendly and usable from any device

Optional PWA (Progressive Web App) support for app-like experience on phones

Community and Trust

Optional feedback system after exchanges (emoji-based or 1-5 rating)

Encourage kindness and honesty with community guidelines

Sustainability Badge

After a certain number of successful giveaways, users earn badges to highlight their positive environmental impact
