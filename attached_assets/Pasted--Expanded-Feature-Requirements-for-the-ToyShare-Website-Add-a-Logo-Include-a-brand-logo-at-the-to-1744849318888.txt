✅ Expanded Feature Requirements for the ToyShare Website
Add a Logo:

Include a brand logo at the top of every page in the navigation bar.

It should appear on desktop and mobile layouts.

Make sure it scales well and links back to the homepage when clicked.

User Dashboard to View Listings:

Add a “My Listings” section or dashboard where logged-in users can view only the toys they’ve posted.

It should list all their active, pending, and completed (traded) toys.

Delete or Mark as Traded:

In the “My Listings” section, each toy should have buttons:

Delete: Removes the listing permanently.

Mark as Traded: Marks the listing as completed and removes it from public view.

Every time a toy is marked as traded, increment a global counter called “Toys Rehomed” or “Making a Difference Together” visible on the homepage or dashboard.

Remove Fake Reviews:

If there are placeholder reviews or testimonials that aren’t real, remove them.

Replace them later with real reviews or remove the review section entirely until it's ready.

Photos and Videos on Listings:

Allow users to upload multiple images (e.g., up to 5) and optional video clips when posting a toy.

Show previews of uploaded content on the listing page.

Accept common formats like JPG, PNG, MP4.

Reduce Amount of Blue in the UI:

The current design uses too much blue. Adjust the color palette to include more neutral tones or a mix of soft pastels (e.g., soft gray, beige, or green) to keep it playful but clean.

FAQ Page with Answers:

Add a proper FAQ page that answers commonly expected questions, like:

“Is ToyShare free to use?”

“How do I contact someone about a toy?”

“What happens after I request a toy?”

“Is my location shared publicly?”

“Can I edit or delete my listing later?”

Email Notification System for Toy Matches:

Let users opt in to email alerts for toys that match their selected:

Location (e.g. ZIP or city)

Tags (e.g. #books, #3-5yrs, #STEM)

When a toy is posted that matches those filters, the user should receive a friendly email notification with a link to view it.

Expanded Tagging System:

Add a larger preset list of tags covering categories like:

#books, #STEM, #outdoor, #puzzles, #vehicles, #games, #infant, #toddler, #7-9yrs, #10+yrs, #girl, #boy, etc.

Let users also create custom tags when posting a toy if the tag they want doesn’t exist yet.

Display tags as clickable filters on the browse/search page.
