Got it â€” you want a **Forgot Password** flow that:

- Lets users enter their email
- Sends them a reset **link or code**
- Lets them change their password
- **Free option only**

Hereâ€™s exactly what you can do for free â€” and text you can paste to Cursor/Agent:

**Implement a Forgot Password Flow**

1. **Authentication Service:**
   - Use **Supabase Auth** for free authentication (email + password login and password reset).
   - Supabase has a built-in **`reset password`** flow that sends users an email with a secure reset link automatically â€” no server code needed.

2. **Requirements:**
   - When a user clicks "Forgot Password" on the login page:
     - Show an input field for email.
     - On submit, call Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail(email)` function.
   - Supabase will automatically send the user a password reset email with a link.

3. **Tech Stack:**
   - Frontend: React (Vite)
   - Auth Backend: Supabase (free tier)

4. **How it should behave:**
   - If the email exists in the database, send a reset link.
   - If the email doesn't exist, still show "If an account exists, a reset link was sent" (for security).
   - After the user clicks the reset link, allow them to enter a new password.

5. **Example Code (React + Supabase):**

```javascript
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient'; // Import your Supabase setup

async function handleForgotPassword(email) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, {
    redirectTo: 'https://your-website.com/reset-password',
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error sending reset email:', error.message);
    alert('Failed to send reset link.');
  } else {
    alert('Check your email for a password reset link!');
  }
}
```

6. **Notes:**
   - Replace `'https://your-website.com/reset-password'` with your own site link where users will reset their password.
   - Set up a simple **Reset Password page** to allow users to submit a new password after clicking the link.
   - Supabase handles the email sending part for free.

7. **Deployment Instructions:**
   - Configure Supabase Project
   - Enable Email Auth in Supabase Auth Settings
   - Set the email sender domain (default free tier works)
   - Deploy React frontend changes to Replit

âœ… If you send that exact text to the Replit Agent, it will know how to build it correctly.  
âœ… If you want, I can also give you **full frontend page code** for the reset password page too (ready to paste).

Would you like me to also give you the **Reset Password Page** code next so users can actually submit a new password?  
It'll connect everything cleanly. ðŸš€
